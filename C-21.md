# C Shortcuts for incrementing and scaling variables
---
    x++; //Increments x, Evaluates to x.
    ++x; //Increments x, Evaluates to x+1.

    x--; //Decrement x, evaluates to x.
    --x; //Decrement x, evaluates to x-1.

    x+=3; //Add three to x.
    x-=7; //Substract seven from x.
    x*=2; //Multiply x by two.
    x/=2; //Divide x by tw0.
    x%=2; //Replace x with modulo.
---

# C True or False definitions
---
    !x //Not x.
    x == y //x equals y.
    x != y //x is not equal to y.
    x < y //x is less than y.
    x <= //x is less than or equal to y
    x || y //x or y.
    x && y //x and y.
    x > y || y >= z //x is greater than y or y is greater than or equal to z.

## C also has a trinary operator
The expression:
    x ? a : b
evaluates to a if x is true, and to b if x is false.
### Example
    #include <math.h>
    #include <stdio>

    int main(){
        double x = 49;
        printf("The truncated square root of x is %g.\n",
            x > 0 ? sqrt(x) : 0);
    }
The trinary conditional operator has a short-circuit(lazy) behavior:
if *x <= 0* , then sqrt(x) is never evaluated.

# Variable placeholders and special characters
    \n //New line.
    \t //A tab.
    %i //Insert an integer value.
    %g //Insert a real number in general format.
    %s //Insert a string of text here.
    %% //Insert a plain percent sign.

# While and For loop
### While loop example
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(){
        int i = 0;                              //Declaring the variable i.
        while (i < 10){                         //Initializing the while loop.
            printf("This is: Loop %i\n", i);    //Prints which loop were at.
            i++                                 //Increments i with each loop.
        }
    }
In the above example if *i* for example would be eleven, then the body of the while loop would be skipped. If we want a while loop to run at least once then there is the *do-while loop*.
### Do-while loop example
    #include <stdio.h>

    void loops(int max){                        //Declaring the max variable inside the loops function.
        int i = 0;
        do {                                    //Tell the programm what to do.
            printf("Hello you.%i\n", i);
            i++;
        } while (i < max);                      //Do it only as long as i is smaller than max.
    }

    int main(){
        loops(3);   //Prints "Hello you." three times.
        loops(0);   //Prints "Hello you." one time.
    }

A while loop is made out of three parts.

- Initialize the variable *(int i=0)*
- Testing the condition *(i < 10)*
- Increment the variable *(i++)*
### For loop example
The for loop uses the exact same steps as the while loop *(Initialize, test, increment)*, but encapsulates them in one place:
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(){
        for (int i=0; i < 10; i++);{            //Initialize, test, increment.
            printf("Hello you.%i\n", i);
        }
    }
